# Ruby on Rails final Project 

Creating and managing an account on the system:

There are three types of users that will interact with the site. The first is the ‘fan’.
A fan doesn’t have to register with the site, but should be able to see a list of
bands registered on the site and have the ability to click on a band to bring up
more information on the band, including a band photo, a sample song, the music
genre that the band belongs to, and where and when the band is playing next.
Users registered with the site include the last two categories: A band manager,
once registered, has the ability to create new bands as well as update and delete
the bands that the manager has created. A site administrator has the ability to
manage all aspects of the site, including users, bands, and genres.

Details about Bands:

The first thing most band managers do after creating an account is to set up a
band. A typical band has a name and description, a genre or genres, a date it is
playing and its start time. Additionally, a band manager can upload a photo of
the band as well as a sample a song. The band manager must be able to see a list
of all the bands the manager manages and have the ability to update or delete
them. An administrator, once logged in, will need to have the list of all bands and the ability to update or delete them. Additionally, the site administrator should have
a separate menu that allows the admin to read, update, and delete users and
genres. Finally, the administrator should have a way of upgrading a registered
user to admin status.
